# DOGENUJ+ MODPACK

## Introduction

Dogenuj (formally known as KUJNUJ) is Minecraft modpack made by Honzapkcz for his semi-private server.
Started by forking Majnr+, it grew up to 400 mods giving optimal performance for even running on mashed potato (honzapkcz here, yes i'm playing on 4k monitor with 14 years old office laptop) and a lot of new content for everyone to never get bored (from looting dungeons to building fusion reactors)!

Everything tech-y goes around these:

- Create (being the main one)
- Tech Reborn (quite new guy)
- Ad Astra (to the moon!)
- Applied Energistics 2
- Computer Craft Tweaked
- about 30 other Create addons
- Valkirien Skies (Clockwork integration)

For adventurers, magicians and gardeners:

- Archon (magic)
- Travelers Backpacks
- Farmers Delight
- Amendments
- Supplementaries
- Regions Unexplored
- Naturalist
- YUNGS Dungeons
- Better End
- Better Nether
- Mythic Upgrades

For builders and tinkerers:

- Chipped

## Installing

## A ~~little bit of~~ history

### Friend's Idea

I didn't play much modpacks before 9th grade. It was always like let's find some cool mods,
mash them together and see what happens. Then Create came out, complete life changer (not only it changed me,
but whole modding community) and just could not play Minecraft without it.

Then best friend (StringedPrune01, sometimes Stay_Fizl) came out to me in 9th grade in 2023 (we went to same middle school) before holidays. He told me he doesn't continue here and will go somewhere else. But because we
didn't want to lose contact, he told me we could create our Minecraft server along the way of Majnr+ (the 
one of the most well known youtuber server here in Czechia), while tweaking some bits.

### KUJNUJ, The Father

The first name was "StringedPrune smells" but officially, Striged came with a name "KUJNUJ". To this day,
nobody really know what it means, just a mangle of words that sound good.

I got some mini desktop from my dad's job storage room marked *to trash*, which in the end was some really
old camera system (that's exactly how I got my current laptop and other e-waste stash). Good enough,
I quickly restored it to fully working minecraft server and web server with dynmap with one bootable Linux
Ubuntu Server USB stick and some screwing.

### Merging with Dogecraft

This is where Dogecraft comes to play. Dogecraft was another server, whose discord I joined through a lot
of interesting relations and friends. They were nothing special, public server with about 20 people trying
to appeal with it's events, giveaways and vanilla+ content. But they had something, players.

My server had problems that it was empty, someone joined so on, but they came through the "2 week grind" and
left. Dogecraft had problems with Aternos (who wouldn't...) they hosted server on. Aternos gives 2.5GB you of 
RAM while the minimal requirements are 4GB! Every time someone joined there was a chance of crash.

It took a little longer (because school) to do, but after many months (of procrastination hehe), I officially
annouced Dogenuj+ 2.0.0 in their discord in #annoucements. Everything had to merge, including logo and name.
At that time I also discovered Tech Reborn (really wanted to add GregTech but found only this for Fabric),
Applied Energistics and whole lot of really nice mods.

### The hassle of beight Fat

The 2.0.0 update is really bulky, yeah the previous were too but here we are on 350+ mods. And things start
to get complicated (or rather interesting?). Many mods now get really opiniated how things are made,
thus creating recipe conflicts or worse, add some really common material like steel, zinc or tin.

I tried to fight back with CraftTweaker, but CraftTweaker soon became my main enemy. It's own language,
it's quirks and every single line throwing more errors that an entire application burned me down.

Then while browsing help on Reddit I found some comment downwoted ("disliked") into oblivion "Just use KubeJS
lmao". Editing recipes and even blocks with javascript became my most favourite thing. (for other developers,
coumentation does mean a lot!!!)

So yeah, I'm currently tweaking my modpack with KubeJS to not fall apart you poke into it.

I hope you enjoyed this ride of dozen paragraphs written at like midnight, documenting this obscure, small,
yet big modpack you just found!
